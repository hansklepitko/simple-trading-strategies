One potential improvement to this trading strategy would be to use a moving average calculation to smooth out fluctuations in the data and provide a better overall sense of the market trend. This could help the algorithm make more informed buy and sell decisions, rather than simply reacting to every small fluctuation in the price.

To implement this, you would need to add code to calculate the moving average of the price data over a certain time period, and then use that moving average value as a reference point in the buy and sell decisions. For example, you could use the moving average to set the buy and sell thresholds dynamically, rather than using fixed values as is done in the current code. This would allow the algorithm to adjust to changing market conditions and potentially improve its performance.

Another potential improvement would be to add more sophisticated logic to the buy and sell decisions. For example, you could use other technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) or the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), to provide additional information about the market trend and help the algorithm make more informed decisions. You could also add code to track the current holdings and cash balance of the trading algorithm, and use that information to make more complex decisions about when to buy, sell, or hold.
